## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap
- Bootstrap Icons

### What I learned

I gained practice with toggled visibility in JavaScript and placing bootstrap icons within an input field. Dynamic error handling and placement was the most rewarding.

### Continued development

I had trouble with turning the custom button into in the input field for the custom tip. I would like more practice with that in the future because I appreciate the seamless UI.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/forms/input-group/) - This helped me setup the input fields.
- [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/person-fill/) - This is where I was able to find the icons.
- [MDN parseFloat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseFloat) - This method turns string to number.
- [MDN parseInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt) - This method turns string to number, no decimal.
